            Hi there! I'm <strong>Mitravan Naaidu</strong>, and I'm currently studying for my Bachelor's Degree in <strong>New Media Communication</strong> at <strong>Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP)</strong>. As someone who has always been drawn to creativity, I found my true calling back in secondary school. It was during a class lesson where we were introduced to digital design for the very first time that something just clicked for me. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to become a graphic designer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since then, my passion for design has only grown stronger. I started exploring how visuals can tell stories, express ideas and even inspire emotions. Whether it is creating digital artwork, designing layouts or experimenting with colours and fonts, I enjoy every part of the creative process. In my scope of life, graphic design is more than just visuals and it's about making an impact and connecting with people in meaningful ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, as I continue my journey at university, I'm working towards turning this passion into a real career. This website shares that journey, the steps I am taking, the people who inspire me and the dreams I wish to come true in coming years. I hope it gives you a better picture of who I am, what I aim to achieve and how I plan to make my mark as a future graphic designer.
